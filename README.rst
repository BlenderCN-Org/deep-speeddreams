Deep-SpeedDreams
##############################


Intention
====================

This is a fork of the SpeedDreams project (version 2.2.1) which works together with the DeepDriving implementation from this repository (**ToDo: Add Link, if finished**). It allows to control a robot-car in this game by calculating 14 driving indicators out of the front-camera picture. 

The original DeepDriving implementation is a project from the princeton university (http://deepdriving.cs.princeton.edu/).

If you are simply looking for the original SpeedDreams project, please visit http://www.speed-dreams.org. Since there are some compile issues on windows with the original version, you can also checkout the tag (`original-2.2.1 <https://bitbucket.org/Netzeband/deep-speeddreams/src/original-2.2.1>`_) from this respository, where several issues are fixed, without containing additional code from the DeepDriving project.
